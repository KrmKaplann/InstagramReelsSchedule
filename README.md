For example, imagine you have **10 Instagram and Facebook** accounts and you need to schedule content for each of them. Doing this manually through Facebook Creator Studio would be quite time-consuming and complicated. Instead, with this Excel-based programme, you can manage and develop your content more easily. Thanks to the flexibility of Excel, you can see all your social media content at a glance and make quick edits when necessary.

Another advantage of the programme is that social media content is stored securely on your computer and can be easily managed. In this way, all the content you produce is stored in an organised way and can be accessed quickly when needed. You can also categorise your content by date, topic and other criteria, allowing you to plan social media more strategically.

In summary, this programme significantly improves the way you plan, manage and optimise your social media content. It provides great convenience for users with multiple accounts and is an indispensable tool for professional social media managers.

## How to use the programme, what is the standard filing style?

In the first step, it is necessary to log in to the folder of the social media site that we will work on. As you can see in the image below, the folders of the main social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest and Twitter are located in this section.

In this step, since we plan to focus primarily on Instagram and Facebook, we log in directly to the Instagram folder. This folder contains all the tools and files to plan and manage Instagram-specific content.

Our programme is designed to enable content to be shared on both Facebook and Instagram. If the Instagram script is executed, the content will be shared on both Instagram and Facebook platforms. However, if only the Facebook script is run, the content will only be shared on Facebook.

Depending on the needs and preferences, necessary revisions can be made on the codes. With this flexibility, you can effectively manage and optimise your content on both platforms.

This process helps you organise your social media content more efficiently and develop a coherent sharing strategy on both platforms.

After logging into the Instagram folder, the second step is to decide which type of post to make. There are two options at this stage and the types of content that our programme can plan are as follows:

**1. Normal Post:** This option is used for standard Instagram posts in the form of photos or videos. Regular posts are displayed on the users' profile page and in the homepage feed of their followers.

**2. Reels Videos:** This option is used for the Reels format, where short and entertaining videos are shared. Reels videos are displayed in the discover section and in users' Reels tab, so they have the potential to reach a wider audience.

At this stage, you can run the relevant code block by selecting which type of content you want to share.

</div>

At this stage, we log in to the Reels folder. Within the Reels folder, there are subfolders belonging to various Instagram accounts. Each folder seen in the image below represents a specific **Instagram account.** These folders contain Reels videos planned to be shared on the relevant accounts.

As we approach the final stages, organising the Excel Sheet is critical to developing an effective sharing strategy. Each Excel Sheet represents an owned Instagram account. With this Excel Planning file, content descriptions, posting dates and times can be organised efficiently.
